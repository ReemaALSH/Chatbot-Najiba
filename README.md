# Chatbot-Najiba

This project is a communication system between the student's families and the school through  AI and NLP.

## Description
With the increasing number of students in schools, there is a need to provide smart systems that help facilitate the process of communication between the school and the students' families.
Where the system consists of two parts:
#### 1. Chatbot system:
This section allows the students' parents to communicate with the school and ask about the student's grades, registration times at school, and the required papers.
It was built using Raza Framwork and provided as a telegram bot.
#### 2. Management system by the school:
This section provides a small school management system that is linked with the chat to provide answers to customers' questions automatically.
It was built using FromWork Django.
